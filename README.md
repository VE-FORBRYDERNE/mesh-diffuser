# Mesh Diffuser

Mesh Diffuser is a work-in-progress JAX framework for running diffusion models for image generation in Google Colab TPU instances and elsewhere (although you would be better off with the many existing frameworks specifically designed for CPUs/GPUs in that case). It is currently non-functional; please check back later.
